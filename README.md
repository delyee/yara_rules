## Hello 

In this repository you can find absolutely free yara rules for searching php shells and other malicious software.

I hope this will be useful for organizations that provide hosting services and specialists who are engaged in cleaning customers/colleaguaes PC from malware.

This is one-person-project made just4fun im my own time - please don't judge the quality. 

If you have a desire to help - here's my contacts for communication [here](https://delyee.github.io/contact) 
or do a pull request ([template](https://github.com/delyee/yara_rules/blob/master/template.yar) is in the root of the repository).

Perhaps this [nonsense](https://github.com/delyee/Ese-gui) written "on the knee" in the 2 evenings, but greatly simplifying work. 
If you have over9999 files - ese-gui can be useful for you!

Except rules that can detect certain php shells, there are Generic rules - they will help you to find potentially malicious scripts quickly and increase the amount of erased backdoors of an attacker.

(sic!) - not all fussed scripts are malicious - an example of this is the directory "FalsePositive," - you shouldn't be scared by yara output and delete all files indiscriminately.
